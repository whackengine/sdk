## Build scripts

For build scripts to run, it is first necessary to have the language tooling working well.

- [ ] Implemented

## Package last modified/"build script is run?" cache file

This cache file, referred to as just "run cache file" (`target/.run-cache.toml`), is stored inside the `target` directory for determining whether a package needs to be updated or not and wether a package's build script has been run or not.

- [ ] Empty a specific package's data from this file if it is
  - [ ] upgraded or
  - [ ] removed

## Update dependencies

In `DependencyUpdate::update_dependencies()`:

- [ ] Check for duplicate. If an already downloaded version is compatible with the required version, then skip update.
- [ ] Check for conflicting versions by reading the `conflicting_dependencies_tracker` table
- [x] Handle local dependencies (no need to symlink them as this has nothing to do with Node.js's `node_modules`)
- [ ] Download registry dependencies into the `target` directory
- [ ] Download Git dependencies into the `target` directory

## DAG

- [ ] Retrieve the DAG interning `Rc<WhackPackage>`s and preventing circular packages.
